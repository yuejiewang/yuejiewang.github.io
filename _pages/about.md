I am a Computer Science Ph.D student at Peking University, advised by Professor Guyue Liu. My research focuses on computer networks and systems, especially trustworthy networks, network verification, and machine learning systems. I received my M.S. in CS from NYU in 2022 and my B.S. in CS from Peking University in 2020.
